I am a postdoc in the Warwick Astronomy and Astrophysics group. I am currently
working with Pier-Emmanuel Tremblay on white dwarfs in the Gaia survey.

# White Dwarfs

I am primarily concerned with the study of white dwarfs, the dense cores of
former stars like our Sun, which represent the end-state of more than 95% of
main-sequence stars overall. These stellar remnants, having exhausted their
internal supply of hydrogen and helium fuel, do not undergo any nuclear fusion
in their interiors (being composed mostly of carbon and oxygen). Instead white
dwarfs can be thought of as stellar embers, slowly radiating away their
internal heat over billions of years, where the oldest white dwarfs in the
Galaxy have cooled from an initial 100,000 K to a relatively cool 3,000 K.

My primary tool in studying white dwarfs is spectroscopy, which astronomers
like myself can probe the physical conditions in the outer layers of stars.
This allows the measurement of the chemical composition, temperature, surface
gravity, pressure, density, and even the presence of magnetic fields.
