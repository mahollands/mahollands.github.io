I am a postdoc in the Warwick Astronomy and Astrophysics group. I am currently
working with Pier-Emmanuel Tremblay on white dwarfs in the Gaia survey.

I am primarily concerned with the study of white dwarfs. This type of stellar
remnant represents the end-state for the 95%+ of main-sequence stars with
masses below 8 Solar-masses, which will not undergo a core-collapse supernova.
Instead, while in the giant-star phase of evolution, the outer 50% of the star
will be ejected in an intense stellar wind. The remaining 50%, no longer
producing pressure via nuclear fusion in the stellar interior, is unable to
contend with the intense gravitational forces. The core thus collapses until
the quantum-phenomenon known as electron-degeneracy pressure can balance
gravity. The result is a hot (100000 K), immensely dense, Earth-sized object --
the white dwarf.

The interior of a typical white dwarf is mostly (99%) a mix of carbon-oxygen
ions in a sea of degenerate electrons. Around this, is an envelope of helium
(about 1% of the mass), and usually, a final shroud of hydrogen (0.01% of the
mass). Our telescopes of course can only directly see the outer-most layers and
what they're made of. Therefore the interior composition is constrained from
our theoretical understanding of how stars evolve, but also from observations
of pulsating white dwarfs where waves travelling through the interior make it
to the surface, providing information on the density of the central
carbon-oxygen core.

Because white dwarfs do not fuse-nuclei in their cores, they instead radiate
away their internal energy, at first cooling rapidly, and then much more slowly
the temperature of the white dwarf outer layers decrease. The oldest white
dwarfs known to the Milky Way can have cooled from an initial 100000 K to a
relatively cool 3000 K (only half the temperature at the surface of the Sun).
Because the processes that affect white dwarf cooling rates are fairly well
understood, the coolest (and thus oldest) white dwarfs provide firm constraints
on the age of the Galactic disk.
