The Gaia satellite, placed in orbit it 2013, has been precisely measuring the
positions of about 1 billion stars. In particular it measures the stellar
parallax, the effect of stellar positions subtly changing as the satellite
orbits the Sun (in tandem with the Earth). The stars nearest the Solar System
have the largest parallaxes, and so this provides the most accurate way to
measure distances to our nearest stellar neighbours. Thanks to Gaia Data
Release 2 (DR2) in April 2018, the parallaxes of one billion stars are now
publically available, for which about 260000 are for white dwarfs. This has
increased the number of known white dwarfs almost ten-fold, and allows us to
learn about these objects in entirely new ways. One of our major new results,
which would have previously been impossible, is the confirmation of
crystallisation of the carbon+oxygen ions in white dwarf interiors (see select
publications below). Thanks to Gaia, great strides are being made in many areas
of astronomy, and so it is an exciting time to be studying white dwarfs.
