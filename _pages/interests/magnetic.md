# Magnetic white dwarfs

For around 20% of white dwarfs, a magnetic field can be detected. These range
from a few kiloGauss (few 0.1 Tesla) all the way up to 1 GigaGauss (100000
Tesla). How these fields are formed is still a matter of debate with
suggestions of Fossil-fields from the main-sequence, dynamo generation during
the giant star phases, dynamo generation in the disks of accreting white
dwarfs, or though the process of interior crystallisation (or maybe some
combination of several of these). Magnetic fields can detected either through
circular polarisation of light from the white dwarf, or (more commonly these
days), via the Zeeman effect that typically causes spectral lines to be split
into three closely spaced lines, where the degree of the splitting corresponds
to the field strength. The most magnetic white dwarfs known, have fields that
cannot be generated in an Earth-based lab and so provide a unique way to learn
about how atoms behave when subjected to extreme magnetism.
