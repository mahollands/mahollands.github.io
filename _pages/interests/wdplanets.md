The transition from the main-sequence to the white dwarf stage should only
destroy the very inner-most part of their planetary-systems, and so white
dwarfs should continue to be orbited by planets for many Gyr after their
formation. We now see direct evidence for these planetary systems resulting
from the disintegration of asteroids (and occasionally comets) which venture
too close to the white dwarf. Once within about a Solar-radius of the white
dwarf, gravitational tides, can shred an asteroid into dust, forming a debris
disk which slowly accretes onto the white dwarf surface. These disks -- heated
by the nearby degenerate star -- can be detected via their emission of
infra-red flux. The chemical elements that make up the asteroids that have
fallen onto the central star can also be detected, as they temporarily alter
the composition of the white dwarf outer layers. Measuring the relative amounts
of these elements (e.g. O, Si, Al, Mg, Ca, Fe, Ni), means we can directly
determine the composition of extraSolar asteroids -- the building blocks from
which exoplanets are formed.
